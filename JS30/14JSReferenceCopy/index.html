    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();//slice with no params returns a copy of the array
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
